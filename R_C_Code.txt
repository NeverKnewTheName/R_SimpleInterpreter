Variables
Strong Typing -> 
    NO Integer, but Int64, UInt64, Int32, UInt32, Int16, UInt16, Int8, UInt8
    NO Float, but Double with precision!
    Numerical values have constraints ->
        Numerical Range of possible values (range or single/multiple value constraints)
        Cast restrictions!
        Arithmetic restrictions! (Integer + Double?)
        
Functions
    Restriction on input parameters ->
        type restrictions as mentioned above
        deductability

Returns
    Restictions on output parameters ->
        type restrictions as mentioned above
        
        
Loops
    No infinite loops!
    
    
    
General Restricitons:
    No dynamic memory allocation!
    No recursion!
