Variables
    Strong Typing -> 
        NO Integer, but Int64, UInt64, Int32, UInt32, Int16, UInt16, Int8, UInt8
        NO Float, but Double with precision!
        Numerical values have constraints ->
            Numerical Range of possible values (range or single/multiple value constraints)
            Cast restrictions!
            Arithmetic restrictions! (Integer + Double?)
    No Pointers ->
        Maybe References!
    
Functions
    Restriction on input parameters ->
        type restrictions as mentioned above
        deductability

Returns
    Restictions on output parameters ->
        type restrictions as mentioned above
        
Loops
    No infinite loops!
    
General Restricitons:
    No dynamic memory allocation!
    No recursion!
    There are no Declarations without Definitions!
    Declarations must be at the beginning of the corresponding Block!
