# R_SimpleInterpreter
A simple lexer, parser(, compiler) and interpreter written in QT for a self defined language that is similar to C.

The language is aimed at embedded control systems that need a higher level of security. Therefore, a range of additions will be added to the language to catch errors at compile time. Additionally, some C features are left out that are error prone in embedded systems (e.g. recursion).

A full explanation will be added soon!
